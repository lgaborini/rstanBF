# rstanBF

rstanBF computes the Bayes Factor for data in specified two-level
hierarchical models.

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/lgaborini/rstanBF.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lgaborini/rstanBF)
[![Codecov test
coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/lgaborini/rstanBF/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/lgaborini/rstanBF?branch=master)

It wraps the package
[bridgesampling](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bridgesampling), and
provides methods to compute the Bayes Factor for comparing two sets of
samples.

## Documentation

Documentation for the stable version is available
[here](https://lgaborini.github.io/rstanBF/).

## Installation

rstanBF is not yet available on CRAN.  
You can install the development version from this repository using
`devtools` or `remotes`:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('lgaborini/rstanBF')
```

### Installation from source

This package uses the C++ build framework set-up by `rstantools`.  
Makevars (`src/Makevars`, `src/Makevars.win`) were overridden to
decrease build-time verbosity.  
To restore them, delete them.  
They will be regenerated by issuing:

``` r
rstantools::rstan_config()
```

## Implemented models

The implemented models are:

-   Dirichlet-Dirichlet
-   Dirichlet-FoldedNormal
-   Dirichlet-DirichletGamma
-   Normal-Normal
